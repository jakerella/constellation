# Constellation

A star-themed graph pattern matching game.

TODO:

- WORKING: daily puzzle via netlify function
- allow player to toggle to stats modal from win modal
- allow loading of specific constellation config ??
- share result online (with image of constellation?)
- have predefined constellations with no layout change ability (actual constellations)
- allow user to draw connection (in addition to tapping two nodes)
- never allow multiple graphs in same puzzle (like 2 single-count nodes connected)... is this a thing?
